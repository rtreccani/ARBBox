# ARBBox
## ARBBox is the verilog part of my final year project, which is an Arbitrary waveform generator. 
## you probably won't be able to build this from the files up here directly, you need to use Alchitry Labs to generate an example 
project, open that in Vivado, and then replace the source (*.v, *.sv) files with mine. This is because the IP generation is finicky.
